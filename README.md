1. First make sure python is installed on your computer. You can either go to the microsoft link or search for it on Microsoft store app.

2. Open Command Prompt
cd into the directory of your choice where the script is at by copying the path and using the cd command. Example if it's on the desktop. "cd C:\Users\bengal\Desktop\swampafk-main"

3. Execute the script
type "python join.py" and press enter

If succesful, your gmod will join the swamp cinema(or rejoin if you are on currently) server in 20-30 seconds the timer will be started and repeat indefinitely every hour.

As long as your internet is stable and you have power, you will be connected.




How it works: 

It uses steam://connect/148.59.74.84 with your browser URL. It interfaces with steam if it's running. It's able to run gmod and it joins the servers IP.
It's on a timer which repeats every 3700 seconds or an hour and a little more(61 minutes). This is the simplest way to always make sure you are connected and AFKing without being too complex.
The biggest hurdle to gaining points while AFK is the auto kick while the server is full, If you're AFK you will be kicked when the server needs more slots. 
The server usually gets full and hits peak hours around 9pm-12am CDT. It makes it random and unpredictable.

You will inevitably lose some points due to the time discrepancy of the rejoin script and when you get kicked.
This can be remedied by the free 10K points you can earn with the swamp.sv title in your name which actually covers most of the loss at peak hours.

The math:

300ppm=75ppm AFK

200ppm=50ppm AFK

75*60=4,500

50*60=3,000

4,500*24=108,000+10,000=~118,000 points per day (24 hours)

4,500*20=90,000+10,000=~100,000 points per day (20 hours)

3,000*24=72,000+10,000=~82,000 points per day (24 hours)

3,000*20=60,000+10,000=~70,000 points per day (20 hours)

118,000*365=43,070,000/12=~3,589,166 points per month at 100% uptime

100,000*365=36,500,000/12=~3,041,666 points per month at 100% uptime

82,000*365=29,930,000/12=~2,494,166 points per month at 100% uptime

70,000*365=25,550,000/12=~2,129,166 points per month at 100% uptime


Even if we assume 4 hours of loss due to downtime or auto AFK kicks with base 200ppm, It's still 70k per day. You could get the 82k at maximum efficiency
but is that effort and complication really worth it for such a simple thing? Not really.
